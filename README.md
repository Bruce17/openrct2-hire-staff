## About

This repository was created to serve as a template TypeScript mod repository for OpenRCT2.

I wanted to leverage [OpenRCT2 hot reload feature](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/blob/develop/distribution/scripting.md#writing-scripts) to make it even more painless to write and debug mods in real time.

This template repository comes with [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on board.

The idea was to use Nodemon to start a local server that will be watching your mod files, then on each save make it build `.ts` files to ES5 `.js` files, place them inside OpenRCT2 `plugin` directory, and let hot reload feature do the rest (i.e. reload the mod in-game).

## Installation

1. Install latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (it should come with `nvm` package) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
2. Create your own repository using this one as a template and clone it anywhere to your PC
3. `cd` into it and edit `config/init.json` - refer to [this](https://github.com/wisnia74/openrct2-typescript-mod-template/tree/master/config) table to know what to edit
4. Still being in repo directory, run `nvm use` to make sure you will run the code with Node that is at least `v10.13.0` (if it prompts you that you don't have this version of Node downloaded try running `nvm install 10.13.0` then `nvm use`)
5. Run `node init.js`
  	* When the script runs `npm init` to generate your npm package, leave `entry` as `init.js`
  	* Everything else is optional
6. You now have a clean repository and npm package configured so you can start modding :)

## Usage

1. If you've set `compileTemlpateMod` in `config/init.json` as `true` go straight to  **step 3.**
2. Otherwise:
	* `cd` into repo
	* run `npm run build:develop` (this will place compiled `./src/<modName>.ts` inside `<openrct2PluginFolderPath>/<modName>/` directory)
3. Make sure you've enabled OpenRCT2 hot reload feature
4. Open `./src/<modName>.ts` in your code editor
5. Run `npm start`
6. Start OpenRCT2 with console and load save/start new game
7. Each time you save the file the server will compile `./src/<modName>.ts` and place it inside `<openrct2PluginFolderPath>/<modName>/` directory
8. OpenRCT2 will notice file changes and it will reload the mods

### How it works
After the `node init.js` script finishes, you are left with a fully functioning npm package, Nodemon, ESLint and TypeScript configured, and also working npm scripts. All changes made by the script got pushed to your repository if you've set `pushToGithub` to `true` before running it.

Your mod files live in `./src/` directory. That's the ones you will be writing code in. 
Upon starting Nodemon server, it will start watching changes you make to files in `./src/`, and it will build them accordingly.

### npm scripts

|script|function|
|--|--|
|`npm start`|starts Nodemon server that will be watching `./src/` directory for any changes you make to `.ts` files inside it|
|`npm run lint`|lints your `.ts` files from `./src/` directory|
|`npm run build:develop`|compiles all `.ts` files from `./src/` to ES5 `.js` files, and places them inside `<openrct2PluginFolderPath>/<modName>/` directory|
|`npm run build`|runs `npm run lint` and if no linting errors are found, compiles your `.ts` files to ES5 `.js` files and places them inside `./dist/` folder - those are your final mod files|

## Releasing your mod

That's not an automated process unfortunately.
After running `npm run build` locally, `./dist/` directory will be created that will contain all the compiled files from `./src/`.
It's up to you, if you want to edit `.gitignore` to actually include `./dist/` contents and push them to your remote or if you want to manually copy the contents of `./dist/` and publish them somewhere. However creating a GitHub release using zipped contents of `./dist/` directory sounds like a cool idea. You would have your mod file available for download straight from the repo.

## Notes

If you've added a new mod folder to `plugin`, and the OpenRCT2 didn't seem like it registered it (and you had a running park), just load the save/start a new park, so OpenRCT2 loads the mods again. Now when you overwrite them during development, there shouldn't be any problems with hot reload noticing file changes.

Nodemon will watch all the files in `./src/` directory, so you're not stuck with the ones that were generated by the script. You can also freely create classes, modules, import them in your mod files. Sky's the limit :)
