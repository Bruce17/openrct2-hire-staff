Template repository for OpenRCT2 mods written in TypeScript.

## Demo
Upon saving the file, it gets compiled, placed in OpenRCT2 `plugin` folder and then OpenRCT2 hot reload feature does the rest. TypeScript features are supported, but on the demo I just show how it works using `console.log`.

## About

This repository was created to serve as a template TypeScript mod repository for OpenRCT2.

I wanted to leverage [OpenRCT2 hot reload feature](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/blob/develop/distribution/scripting.md#writing-scripts) to make it even more painless to write and debug mods in real time.

This template repository comes with [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on board.

The idea was to use Nodemon to start a local server that will be watching your mod files, then on each save make it build `.ts` files to ES5 `.js` files, place them inside OpenRCT2 `plugin` directory, and let hot reload feature do the rest (i.e. reload the mod in-game).

## Installation

- install latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- create your own repository using this one as a template and clone it anywhere to your PC
- `cd` into it and edit `config/init.json` - refer to [this](https://github.com/wisnia74/openrct2-typescript-mod-template/tree/master/config) table to know what to edit
- run `node init.js`
  	- when the script runs `npm init` to generate your npm package, leave `entry` as `init.js`
  	- everything else is optional
- you now have a clean repository and npm package configured so you can start modding :)

## Usage

- If you've set `compileTemplateMod` in `config/init.json` as `true`:
	- make sure you've enabled OpenRCT2 hot reload feature - read more about how to enable it [here](https://github.com/wisnia74/openrct2-typescript-mod-template/blob/master/demo.gif)
	- open `./src/<modName>.ts` in your code editor
	- run `npm start`
	- start OpenRCT2 with console and load save/start new game
	- each time you save the file the server will compile `./src/<modName>.ts` and place it inside `<openrct2PluginFolderPath>/<modName>/` directory
	- OpenRCT2 will notice file changes and it will reload the mods
- If you've set `compileTemplateMod` in `config/init.json` as `false`:
	- you still follow all the above steps, but before them you need to
		- `cd` into repo
		- run `npm run build:develop`
	- this will place compiled `./src/<modName>.ts` inside `<openrct2PluginFolderPath>/<modName>/` directory

#### How it works
After the `node init.js` script finishes, you are left with a fully functioning npm package, Nodemon, ESLint and TypeScript configured, and also working npm scripts. All changes made by the script got pushed to your repository if you've set `pushToGithub` to `true` before running it.

Your mod files live in `./src` directory. That's the ones you will be writing code in. 
Upon starting Nodemon server, it will start watching changes you make to files in `./src`, and it will build them accordingly.

#### npm scripts:

|script|function|
|--|--|
|`npm start`|starts Nodemon server that will be watching `./src` folder for any changes you make to `.ts` files inside it|
|`npm run lint`|lints your `.ts` files from `./src` directory|
|`npm run build:develop`|compiles all `.ts` files from `./src` to ES5 `.js` files, and places them inside `<openrct2PluginFolderPath>/<modName>/` directory|
|`npm run build`|runs `npm run lint` and if no linting errors are found, compiles your `.ts` files to ES5 `.js` files and places them inside `./dist` folder - those are your final mod files|

## Notes

If you've added a new mod folder to `plugin`, and the OpenRCT2 didn't seem like it registered it (and you had a running park), just load the save/start a new park, so OpenRCT2 loads the mods again. Now when you overwrite them during development, there shouldn't be any problems with hot reload noticing file changes.

Nodemon will watch all the files in `./src/` directory, so you're not stuck with the ones that were generated by the script. You can also freely create classes, modules, import them in your mod files. Sky's the limit :)
